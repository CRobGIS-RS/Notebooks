# Notebooks
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks developed to provide visualizations for various projects

## climate_ag_mysql_visualization.ipynb
Contains visualizations developed for my CSIS638 Final Project. The various visualizations provide a means for exploring Climate and Agricultural Data at the state and county levels. Users can visualize trends over time in crop production for a county and/or state of interest and how they relate to changes in climatic variables. 

Visualization is a vital component of any exploratory data analysis to help bring particular aspects of the data into focus. Given the variety and scales of information available in the data used for this project, it was important to provide a variety of tools to assist its investigation. Using Jupyter Notebooks, a prototype dashboard was developed featuring visualizations implemented through the Matplotlib and Seaborn packages for building familiarity with the data.
